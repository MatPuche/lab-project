The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

The layer will not be\n * rendered outside of this extent.\n * @property {number} [zIndex] The z-index for layer rendering.  At rendering time, the layers\n * will be ordered, first by Z-index and then by position. When `undefined`, a `zIndex` of 0 is assumed\n * for layers that are added to the map's `layers` collection, or `Infinity` when the layer's `setMap()`\n * method was used.\n * @property {number} [minResolution] The minimum resolution (inclusive) at which this layer will be\n * visible.\n * @property {number} [maxResolution] The maximum resolution (exclusive) below which this layer will\n * be visible.\n * @property {number} [minZoom] The minimum view zoom level (exclusive) above which this layer will be\n * visible.\n * @property {number} [maxZoom] The maximum view zoom level (inclusive) at which this layer will\n * be visible.\n * @property {import(\"../render.js\").OrderFunction} [renderOrder] Render order. Function to be used when sorting\n * features before rendering. By default features are drawn in the order that they are created. Use\n * `null` to avoid the sort, but get an undefined draw order.\n * @property {number} [renderBuffer=100] The buffer in pixels around the viewport extent used by the\n * renderer when getting features from the vector source for the rendering or hit-detection.\n * Recommended value: the size of the largest symbol, line width or label.\n * @property {import(\"../source/Vector.js\").default} [source] Source.\n * @property {import(\"../PluggableMap.js\").default} [map] Sets the layer as overlay on a map. The map will not manage\n * this layer in its layers collection, and the layer will be rendered on top. This is useful for\n * temporary layers. The standard way to add a layer to a map and have it managed by the map is to\n * use {@link module:ol/Map#addLayer}.\n * @property {boolean} [declutter=false] Declutter images and text. Decluttering is applied to all\n * image and text styles of all Vector and VectorTile layers that have set this to `true`. The priority\n * is defined by the z-index of the layer, the `zIndex` of the style and the render order of features.\n * Higher z-index means higher priority. Within the same z-index, a feature rendered before another has\n * higher priority.\n * @property {import(\"../style/Style.js\").StyleLike|null} [style] Layer style. When set to `null`, only\n * features that have their own style will be rendered. See {@link module:ol/style} for default style\n * which will be used if this is not set.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileAnimating=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will\n * be recreated during animations. This means that no vectors will be shown clipped, but the\n * setting will have a performance impact for large amounts of vector data. When set to `false`,\n * batches will be recreated when no animation is active.\n * @property {boolean} [updateWhileInteracting=false] When set to `true`, feature batches will\n * be recreated during interactions.
